# CSC380-Oswego-Project

This project was done by my parter and I for a class. The purpose of this assigment was to work in an agile environment while being exposed to new tools to aid in software development such as maven and Junit.

The project itself was to create a simiple libray interface in the span of one semester (~3 months).

My partner made the framework, design and interactions of the GUI, which opperates primaly on a caching.

I made all of the internal code's functionality and layout. In addation I intergrated most of the internal codebase with the GUI while forming small edits to the GUI classes to work around the pregenerated code.

In the end the program has a hierarchy of accounts (user, employee and employer) and a database for books. Throughout the development of this system, small subsystems were made such as searching for books and operations upon fees. All subsystems would funnel into the class Handler which would be used to store current data and pass data as needed to and from the internal workings and the GUI operations.

This was a fun project, yet far from being complete. 
A list of things we would had liked to see done:
1) expanded the programs ability to search for books stored in its database
2) change the storage from local to server
3) change current GUI to a handmade GUI instead of using the generated code from NetBeans and force coding certain operations to get things to work (did this due to time constrants and limited people)
4) Make the code base more readable.

In the end, the program met the bar functionality of a library app while look presentable which landed us a 98 on this project.
